## .NET Core CLI and .NET Standard

.right.bottom.bold[**@tlycken** on Slack, GitHub, Twitter...]

???

My name is Tomas Lycken. I've met most of you, and the rest of you have
probably seen my handle on Slack, or - at the very least - gotten a couple
of emails about GitHub permissions lately...

I've been at Jayway for about two and a half years. I work with .NET,
primarily backend. If I got to choose I'd use .NET Core and F#, but in
reality it's more often .NET Framework and C#... And if I have to work with
web frontend I prefer React, and I'm curious about TypeScript...

In the competence assistance this talk is titled
".NET Core CLI and .NET Standard", but I've decided to instead call it...

... dotnet with sparkles and unicorns.

There's a lot of ground to cover, and Microsoft have introduced a lot of
new and shiny features, so I'll do my best to show off the things I think
are most awesome.

I'll start with a few slides on the various parts of this new .NET eco-
system, like the .NET Standard, .NET Core, .NET Framework and how they all
relate to each-other. Once we've covered that, which will take about 15
minutes, the rest of the talk is mostly demos of various aspects of the
new SDK and how you can start using it today.

#The .NET Standard

???

So, what is the .NET Standard? What problem does it solve?

The main pain point is multi-targeting.

---

## The .NET world we knew

![yesterday](/slides/images/dotnet-yesterday.png)

.bottom.right[Image from the announcement blog post: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/]

???

So, before the .NET Standard was introduced, each .NET runtime had its own
base library. Many components were available on multiple, or even all, platforms,
such as generic collections and LINQ, but even if the interface was the same,
there was no guarantee that the actual implementation was the same.

This made writing apps for multiple platforms a pain.

## Brave new .NET

![yesterday](/slides/images/dotnet-today.png)

.bottom.right[Image from the announcement blog post: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/]

???

With the .NET Standard, there's a way for the application to specify what it needs,
and to figure out whether a particular runtime supports its needs.

# ...?
???

But if you are like me, this isn't really enough to *grok* what the .NET Standard is. There has to be a better way to explain it, right?

David Fowler on the ASP.NET Core team found a way that I think is way
superior to anything else I've seen. It's brilliant mainly because it talks
about these new things in a language you all already know quite well: C#.

Source: https://gist.github.com/davidfowl/8939f305567e1755412d6dc0b8baf1b7

## The .NET Standard defines available APIs

```c#
interface INetStandard10
{
    void Primitives();
    void Reflection();
    void Tasks();
    void Collections();
    void Linq();
}

interface INetStandard11 : INetStandard10
{
    void ConcurrentCollections();
    void InteropServices();
}

// ...and so on until

interface INetStandard20 : INetStandard16
{
    // lots of stuff
}
```

???

So, we can see the .NET Standard as a set of interfaces, defining APIs that should
be available for a given runtime to meet the standard. The classes that eventually
implement these interfaces are *.NET Platforms*, on which you can run your applications.


---

## Full .NET Framework implements the standard

```c#
interface INetFramework45 : INetStandard11
{
    void FileSystem();
    void Console();
    void ThreadPool();
    void Crypto();
    void WebSockets();
    void Process();
    void Sockets();

    void AppDomain();
    void Xml();
    void Drawing();
    void SystemWeb();
    void WPF();
    void WindowsForms();
    void WCF();
}

interface INetFramework451 : INetFramework45, INetStandard12
{
    // ...
}
```

###.right[...and may provide extra APIs]


???

But of course, these platforms might have other interfaces too, not specified
in the standard, so lets create interfaces for the platforms as well.

---

## Other platforms also implement the standard

```c#
interface IMono43 : INetFramework46
{
    void MonoSpecificApi();
}

interface IWindowsUniversalPlatform : INetStandard14 // Windows Universal Platform
{
    void GPS();
    void Xaml();
}

interface IXamarinIOS : INetStandard15
{
    void AppleAPIs();
}

interface IXamarinAndroid : INetStandard15
{
    void GoogleAPIs();
}
```

???

Mind you, there are other platforms than the full .NET Framework - as I'm sure
all the #winclient people here are eager to point out. Those fit well into this
analogy as well.

---

## ...and the standard helps define what a future platform can do!

```c#
interface ISomeFuturePlatform : INetStandard13
{
    // A future platform chooses to implement a specific .NET Standard version.
    // All libraries that target that version are instantly compatible with this new
    // platform
}
```

???

We can even use the standard to define what some *future* platform will be
capable of, even if that platform hasn't been built yet!

By making a platform implement a specific version of the standard, all apps
and libraries compatible with that standard are instantly compatible with
the new platform.

# .NET Core

???

So, where does .NET Core fit into this analogy?

Naming is hard, and Microsoft are bad at it. So, there are multiple things being
referred to as ".NET Core", and it can be a little confusing. Therefore, let's
focus first on one of the parts, and get to the others later:

Let's talk about the .NET Core Runtime.

---

## .NET Core is a platform, just like the others!

```c#
interface INetCoreApp10 : INetStandard15
{
}

interface INetCoreApp11 : INetStandard16
{
}

interface INetCoreApp20 : INetStandard20
{
}
```

???

In this analogy, .NET Core is a platform implementation, just like .NET Framework,
Mono or UWP. They aren't equal in the sense that they all support the same stuff,
or (probably) in the sense that they get equal attention from Microsoft, but in
terms of the Standard, they're actually equally important.

Let me say that again: in terms of the Standard, Mono and the full .NET Framework
have equal merit and value. I think that's a pretty cool move by Microsoft.

As you know, there are currently three versions of the .NET Core runtime platform:
1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. In 2.0, *almost* all of the things that already existed in .NET
Framework are included, so any platform supporting that (e.g. .NET Core 2.0) can
run *almost* all applications written for .NET Framework 4.6.

# Targeting the .NET Standard

???

So, how do you build software for the .NET Standard?

---


## Targeting the .NET Standard

Applications target runtimes:
```c#
public void Net45Application(INetFramework45 platform)
{
    platform.FileSystem();
    platform.Console();

    NetStandardLibrary(platform);
}
```

Libraries target the Standard:
```c#
public void NetStandardLibrary(INetStandard11 platform)
{
    platform.FileSystem();
    platform.Console();
}

// reminder: .NET Framework 4.5 supports .NETStandard 1.1
interface INetFramework45 : INetStandard11 { /*...*/ } 
```

???

As a general rule, applications target runtimes, libraries target the standard.

This way, when authoring a library, you can make sure that your library works on
*any* runtime that supports the version of the Standard you're targeting. No more
complicated portable class library configurations - just one build of the dll
works on all platforms.

But of course, if you're building an application and want to use libraries targeting
a specific version of the .NET Standard, you must ensure that the platform you're
building your app for implements that version of the standard.

In this example, the library needs .NET Standard 1.1 and the application runs on
.NET Framework 4.5. Since .NET Framework 4.5 implements .NET Standard 1.1, that works
out fine.

---

## Targeting the .NET Standard

Applications target runtimes:
```c#
public void Net45Application(INetFramework45 platform)
{
    platform.FileSystem();
    platform.Console();

    NetStandardLibrary(platform); // <-- ERROR
}
```

Libraries target the Standard:
```c#
public void NetStandardLibrary(INetStandard13 platform) // <-- note: it's now 1.3
{
    platform.FileSystem();
    platform.Console();
}

// reminder: .NET Framework 4.5 supports .NETStandard 1.1
interface INetFramework45 : INetStandard11 { /*...*/ } 
```

???

But what if the library author updates the library with some new stuff that requires
the .NET Standard 1.3?

With a library targeting a higher version of the standard than what your platform
supports, you'll get errors.

---

## Multi-targeting on the .NET Standard

```c#
public void Net451Application(INetFramework451 platform)
{
    MultipleTargetsLibrary(platform);
}

public void NetCoreApplication(INetCoreApp10 platform)
{
    MultipleTargetsLibrary(platform);
}

public void MultipleTargetsLibrary(INetFramework45 platform)
{
    platform.FileSystem();
}

public void MultipleTargetsLibrary(INetStandard13 platform)
{
    platform.FileSystem();
}
```

???

Here we have two applications that depend on a library, and the library is built
for multiple targets. (I'll demo later how you build a library to support this.)

For the full .NET Framework 4.5.1 application, we select the best compatible
version of the library, which happens to be the one built for .NET 4.5.

For the .NET Core application, we can't use a framework for .NET 4.5, but we *can*
use one for .NET Standard 1.3, since the .NETCoreApp1.0 target implements .NET Standard
1.5, which is a superset of 1.3.

???

So, you've all probably googled the .NET Standard to see if you could grok it,
ended up with this table, and given up. I know I have.

Now that you know how to think about what a .NET Standard version is, what a
runtime platform is, and how they relate to each-other, it shouldn't be too hard,
though.

There are two questions this table answers, depending on if you're writing a library
or an application:

* For library authors: what version of .NET Standard do I need to support to be
able to support platform X?
* For application authors: what version of .NET Standard must the package I want
to use support, in order to work in my production environment?

Let's consider an example:

You're writing a web application that needs to run on .NET Framework 4.6.1. You can use whatever tools you want to build the app, though, so of course you're on the new and shiny SDK.

That means that *all* .NET Standard versions are available to you.

That means that you can use any library targeting .NET Standard 1.2 *or lower*.

Now, if you could only use version 1.x of the .NET Core SDK (for whatever reason), your options would be more limited. Instead of using libraries for whatever version of the
.NET Standard, you can now only use libraries targeting .NET Standard 1.4 or lower.

Another one:

You're writing a library, that needs to support both the full .NET Framework and the UWP. Versions aren't so important, as long as they're actually released.

The current release of UWP supports .NET Standard 1.4, so you can use that, but not 1.5 or above.

# The .NET Core SDK

???

Let's talk about the new SDK.

The SDK actually has a couple of different components, and several interfaces.
You'll most likely use either Visual Studio integration (from VS2017, 15.3), or
the `dotnet` CLI.

And since it's easier to show off all the things you can do by actually doing them...
