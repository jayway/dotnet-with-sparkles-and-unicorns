My name is Tomas Lycken. I've met most of you, and the rest of you have
probably seen my handle on Slack, or - at the very least - gotten a couple
of emails about GitHub permissions lately...

I work with .NET, primarily backend but if I have to work with web frontend
I prefer React, and I'm curious about TypeScript...

In the competence assistance this talk is titled
".NET Core CLI and .NET Standard", but I've decided to instead call it...

There's a lot of ground to cover, and Microsoft have introduced a lot of
new and shiny features, so I'll do my best to show off the things I think
are most awesome.

I'll start with a few slides on the various parts of this new .NET eco-
system, like the .NET Standard, .NET Core, .NET Framework and how they all
relate to each-other. Once we've covered that, the rest of the talk is mostly
demos of various aspects of the new SDK and how you can start using it today.
